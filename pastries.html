    <p> Our range of mouth watering pastries are home made with care and love. Every sprinkle, every carefully placed decoration are placed with complete specialised care.
        We hope you all enjoy them as much as we do! 
        Each pastry represents something different, they are inspired by different people and they really do represent the art of creativity. At Caffeinated Creations everyone
        has the chance to be creative in their own way, everyone has the chance to stand-out and be eccentric. If you dont believe that then just take a look at our pastries and our drinks.
